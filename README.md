# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Lydia Cartwright

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

There are three levels the player can chose from, the first is easy and it has 4 buttons and five notes
to play back. The second level is intermediate and it has 6 buttons and 10 notes to play back. The final level
is hard and it has 8 buttons with 15 notes to play back.

## Video Walkthrough

The computer randomly generates the pattern, it is different each time:

Users get 3 chances to pick the wrong button, see this in the intermediate level:

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I used this website to find more colors within CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

Prior to working on this project, I had never really worked in an IDE outside of Bluej. In addition to this,
I mainly worked in java and didn’t have much experience with other coding languages. To overcome this, I took
my time reading all the dropdown tabs for more information and I followed the links to look at the sources
provided. This allowed me to have a deeper understanding of what the code I was writing meant and how it affected
the end result of the game. It helped as well to make small changes to the lines of code to see how different
variations changed the game. Carefully analyzing the code also helped me to understand how it functioned and made
it more clear how each code segment worked with others to perform in the expected manner. Overall, reviewing given
documentation and taking the time to look over all the pieces of the code helped me to understand how it worked and
allowed me to learn a bit about the languages, HTML and CSS, as well as the Glitch IDE. I look forward to using this
in the future to further my learning in the field and work on projects with web development.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

After completing this project I’m curious to learn more about web development. I’d like to learn more about the
different aspects and classes available to use while working on designing an app or user interface. I also would
like to know how much Glitch can do, as in what it can make, and if it’s commonly used in the industry or more for
learning purposes. I would also like some experience creating web pages, as I’m wondering how similar the process
is to create an app. I also would like to learn how the app can be taken from Glitch or GitHub and be downloaded
for use on a person’s device.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had more time to work on this project, there are some specific things I would work on. First, I would make it
so the user cannot make their guess while the computer is still giving the clues as this can cause the user to either
accidentally start guessing to early and mess up, or just follow along for the answers. I would also try to make the
application look more modern, and maybe include different settings or themes. Another way I might change the project
would be to allow the user to pick the instrument used, or have each button correspond to a different instrument.
